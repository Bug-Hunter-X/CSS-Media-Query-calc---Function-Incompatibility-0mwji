To resolve the incompatibility, it is recommended to avoid using `calc()` directly in media query conditions.  Instead, determine the breakpoint using JavaScript or a CSS preprocessor (such as Sass or Less) and then apply the appropriate styles based on the calculated value.

Here's an example using JavaScript to set the media query breakpoint dynamically:

```javascript
const viewportWidth = window.innerWidth;
const breakpoint = viewportWidth - 100; // Calculate the breakpoint

document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--breakpoint', `${breakpoint}px`);
```

And in your CSS, use the custom property:

```css
@media (max-width: var(--breakpoint)) {
  .element {
    width: 50%;
  }
}
```

This approach ensures the media query works consistently across browsers by decoupling the breakpoint calculation from the media query definition.
